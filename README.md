# Sugar on Raspberry Pi in VMs

This README provides instructions for setting up and running Sugar on a Raspberry Pi within different Virtual Machine (VM) environments.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Raspberry Pi hardware or emulator (such as QEMU)
- Virtual Machine software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware)
- [Sugar](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar) - Ensure that Sugar is installed on your Raspberry Pi or emulator.

## Installation Steps

### Linux VM

1. **Set up Raspberry Pi:**
   - If using a physical Raspberry Pi, make sure it is properly set up with an operating system (e.g., Raspbian).
   - If using an emulator like QEMU, follow the specific instructions for setting up the Raspberry Pi emulation.

2. **Install Virtual Machine Software:**
   - Choose a Linux-compatible Virtual Machine software (e.g., VirtualBox, QEMU) and install it on your Linux system.

3. **Create a Virtual Machine:**
   - Open your Linux VM software and create a new virtual machine.
   - Configure the virtual machine settings, ensuring it meets the requirements for running Sugar.

4. **Continue with common steps 4-8.**

### Windows VM

1. **Set up Raspberry Pi:**
   - If using a physical Raspberry Pi, make sure it is properly set up with an operating system (e.g., Raspbian).
   - If using an emulator like QEMU, follow the specific instructions for setting up the Raspberry Pi emulation.

2. **Install Virtual Machine Software:**
   - Choose a Windows-compatible Virtual Machine software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) and install it on your Windows system.

3. **Create a Virtual Machine:**
   - Open your Windows VM software and create a new virtual machine.
   - Configure the virtual machine settings, ensuring it meets the requirements for running Sugar.

4. **Continue with common steps 4-8.**

### macOS VM

1. **Set up Raspberry Pi:**
   - If using a physical Raspberry Pi, make sure it is properly set up with an operating system (e.g., Raspbian).
   - If using an emulator like QEMU, follow the specific instructions for setting up the Raspberry Pi emulation.

2. **Install Virtual Machine Software:**
   - Choose a macOS-compatible Virtual Machine software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) and install it on your macOS system.

3. **Create a Virtual Machine:**
   - Open your macOS VM software and create a new virtual machine.
   - Configure the virtual machine settings, ensuring it meets the requirements for running Sugar.

4. **Continue with common steps 4-8.**
